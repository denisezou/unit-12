# unit-12

Hi there, this Node application shows a menu of products and allows you to select which id number and quantity you wish to purchase. Issues: I did not implement a check to see whether the quantity was larger than what was requested and I did not implement a validation of id numbers that were not on the menu. I only got the updating quantity function working 5 minutes ago- my apologies!
